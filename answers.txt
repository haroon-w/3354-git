(c) What is the difference between git log and git status?

	git log: Shows all the commit logs; Has different options on how one may want 
		 to view the commmit history
	
	git status: Shows the current status of the working directory that the 
		    user may be using, such as current changes made to files that are being
		    tracked. Is not meant to be used to browse commit history, rather shows
		    user information such as how many commits you are ahead of master, etc.

(d) What is the difference between unstaged and untracked files?
	 
	Unstaged Files: These files are tracked by git which means that git will track whether 
			these files have been modified or deleted. Unstaged files are not 
			committed.

	Untracked Files: These files are not tracked by git, meaning that if they are modified 
			 or deleted, git will not notice.

(e) What is the difference between git checkout and git reset?
	
	git checkout: Used to move between branches, can also be used to create new branches by using "-b".

	git reset: Used to undo a commit by deleting the commit mentioned. User should use git revert
		   instead of settling for git reset, as git revert tracks whenever changes are made
		   (git reset does not).

(f) What happens if you try to pull remote changes when there are uncommitted
changes in your working directory?

	User will be stopped from pulling the information and will be prompted to 
	either commit or stash their changes before proceeding.
